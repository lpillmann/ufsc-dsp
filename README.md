# Project to play around with DSP
*UFSC EEL7065 - Sinais e sistemas discretos*

At first, testing with both Octave and Python. 

## Some tests with Octave
Octave seems to be the very best option, once it's (almost) fully compatible with MATLAB. However, MATLAB example files are not readily available. Try to find them somewhere, somehow!

## Filter design with Python
Python and `scipy.signal` works quite well too. Explored some functions in folder *homework*, designing digital filters for voice and DTMF tones.

Used Jupyter as Python interface.
